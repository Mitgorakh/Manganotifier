# Manganotifier
This is a simple script to notify you when new chapters of your favorite manga are available online. 
This script checks the site mangafox.com for the latest manga.
Just add the links to your favorite manga on mangafox.com to the file mangalist.txt and execute the manga.py file.
It will notify if a new chapter is available. Also a file with the links to the new chapters will open at the end of execution.
The script will execute every 4 hours and it will keep running infinitely. You can change how often it checks for the new manga on the last line of the code.
Also it will store which the latest chapter was the last time you ran the script. Hence it will not display a notification for that same chapter again.
